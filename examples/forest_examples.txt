In the example profiles below 100 = P+Q+R, and  50>P>Q>R>0.  One consequence of these constraints is that in all three profiles below the cycle A>B>C>A will obtain.

I am interested in simple methods that always ...

(1) elect candidate A given the following profile:
P: A
Q: B>>C
R: C,
and 
(2) elect candidate C given
P: A
Q: B>C>>
R: C,
and 
(3) elect candidate B given
P: A
Q: B>>C  (or B>C)
R: C>>B. (or C>B)


Methods that comply:  
with explicit Approval cutoff:
    Smith//Approval
    CW-full//CW-approved (flatten disapproval)//Approval
    Approval Sorted Margins
